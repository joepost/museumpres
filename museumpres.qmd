## Context

-   Working in the data team of Alfred Hospital's Infectious Diseases Department (Melbourne, Australia)

-   Focus on **healthcare acquired infections**, **antimicrobial resistance**, and **notifiable diseases**

-   Support department to transition away from archaic manual processes

---

## Challenge

-   Infection prevention (IP) nursing team use paper records and Excel to trace contacts

::: {.incremental}
-   Process:
    1.  Pathology notifies IP of resistant test result
    2.  IP accesses patient records and ward history
    3.  IP downloads table of entry/exit times for all patients for each contact ward
    4.  IP manually checks through list to identify contacts against criteria

- Time-consuming, error-prone, and poorly documented

## Solution

Our aim was to build a tool that would both **automate** and **visualise** the contact tracing process for the IP clinicians.  

Needs to be simple to use and intuitive for end-users (non-coders).
