## Context {background-color=rgba(51,51,51,255)}

-   Working in the data team of Alfred Hospital's Infectious Diseases Department (Melbourne, Australia)

-   Focus on **healthcare acquired infections**, **antimicrobial resistance**, and **notifiable diseases**

-   Support department to transition away from archaic manual processes

::: {.notes}

This example I wanted to focus on something applied in a professional context, not a traditional academic environment, because I think it aligns well with this role's position description - with a focus on improving processes and data management to support the end user (such as the clinician or researcher).

## Challenge {background-color=rgba(51,51,51,255)}

Infection prevention nursing team (IP) use paper records and Excel to trace contacts.

::: incremental
-   Process:
    1.  Pathology notifies IP of resistant test result
    2.  IP accesses patient records and ward history
    3.  IP downloads table of entry/exit times for all patients for each contact ward
    4.  IP manually checks through list to identify contacts against criteria

::: {.notes}

Contacts here refers to patients who shared a room or space with another patient who has tested positive to a multi-resistant organism, and meets certain criteria (such as greater than 24 hours spent in same room).

## Challenge {background-color=rgba(51,51,51,255)}

Infection prevention nursing team (IP) use paper records and Excel to trace contacts.

This is **time-consuming**, **error prone**, and **poorly documented**.

## Solution {background-color=rgba(51,51,51,255)}

Our aim was to build a tool that would both **automate** and **visualise** the contact tracing process for the IP clinicians.

Needed to be... 

-   simple to use and intuitive for end-users (non-coders)

-   transparent (not a 'black box')

-   secure (contains confidential patient record data)

::: {.notes}

Simple and intuitive to use, understanding that the end user (the IP nurses) are subject matter experts in infectious disease, but are often not data and digitally confident. 

Transparency is important to build trust in a new process. Rather than set up a script that automatically identifies contacts and spits out a list of 'who to investigate' as the end result, we wanted all the input data to be clear and accessible to IP, so that they could see exactly how the digital tool aligned with the existing process.

Finally, the tool needs to meet the high data privacy and security standards of the hospital, as it contains confidential patient record data.

## Process {background-color=rgba(51,51,51,255)}

1.    Set up an SQL extract for pathology and ward location data from the hospital's central data warehouse 

2.    Develop an R shiny app to visualise the patient and room locations in a Gantt-style chart

3.    Automatically identify and highlight patient contacts that meet specified criteria 

4.    Host shiny app on internal server with protected access (IP team only)

::: {.notes}

Worked with the central IT team to gain access to the data warehouse, and build an SQL query that would routinely draw the raw data on pathology results and ward locations for positive patients and their potential contacts.

## Outcome {background-color=rgba(51,51,51,255)}
::: incremental
-   The tool was implemented after a 3-month validation period (where both processes were performed and compared).  

-   Significantly faster than previous manual process

-   Easier to integrate IP contact tracing into reporting and audit workflows 

-   Presented the tool at the [Australasian College for Infection Prevention and Control (ACIPC) International Conference](https://acipcconference.com.au/events/two-heads-are-better-than-one-collaboration-and-implementation-of-novel-data-analytics-for-rapid-outbreak-detection-in-a-large-victorian-healthcare-facility/) in 2021.

::: {.notes}

A 3-month validation process was used to monitor the accuracy of the tool, in comparison to the previous method. It also gave a period of training and familiarity with the tool to the IP team, so that they were confident and ready to use it once implemented in standard practice. This particularly also helped build buy-in from the broader IP team, as they saw in practice the time and work saved by the new process. 

The time and workload saving became especially valuable as the Department continued to grapple with the massive workload change of the COVID pandemic.

Having the data in ready-to-use format made it easier to integrate into downstream reporting, such as quarterly audits that captured the total cases and contacts identified, and the positivity rate for transmission. 

The success of the tool's implementation in the Infectious Diseases Department was reflected in a presentation at the ACIPC International Conference.
